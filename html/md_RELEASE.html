<h1>Release 3.0</h1>
<p>Apollo 3.0 enables L4 product level solution that allows vehicles to drive in a closed venue setting at a low speed. Automakers can now leverage this one stop solution for autonomous driving without having to customize on their own.</p>
<h2>Major Features And Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>New Safety module called Guardian</li>
<li>Enhanced Surveillance module - Monitor</li>
<li>Hardware service layer that will now act like a platform and not a product, giving developers the flexibility to integrate their own Hardware</li>
<li>Apollo Sensor Unit (ASU)</li>
<li>New Gatekeeper - Ultrasonic Sensor</li>
<li>Perception module changes:<ul>
<li><b>CIPV(Closest In-Path Vehicle) detection and Tailgating</b>: The vehicle in front of the ego-car is detected and its trajectory is estimated for more efficient tailgating and lane keeping when lane detection is unreliable.</li>
<li><b>Asynchronous sensor fusion</b>: unlike the previous version, Perception in Apollo 3.0 is capable of consolidating all the information and data points by asynchronously fusing LiDAR, Radar and Camera data. Such conditions allow for more comprehensive data capture and reflect more practical sensor environments.</li>
<li><b>Online pose estimation</b>: This new feature estimates the pose of an ego-vehicle for every single frame. This feature helps to drive through bumps or slopes on the road with more accurate 3D scene understanding.</li>
<li><b>Ultrasonic sensors</b>: Perception in Apollo 3.0 now works with ultrasonic sensors. The output can be used for Automated Emergency Brake (AEB) and vertical/perpendicular parking.</li>
<li><b>Whole lane line</b>: Unlike previous lane line segments, this whole lane line feature will provide more accurate and long range detection of lane lines.</li>
<li><b>Visual localization</b>: Cameras are currently being tested to aid and enhance localization</li>
<li><b>16 beam LiDAR support</b></li>
